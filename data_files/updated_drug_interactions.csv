4	Tiaprofenic acid	Verteporfin	Tiaprofenic acid may increase the photosensitizing activities of Verteporfin.	Moderate	"Tiaprofenic acid can significantly increase Verteporfin-induced photosensitivity, increasing the risk of phototoxic skin damage, erythema, and localized blistering. Patients should minimize UV exposure and use preventive measures, including protective clothing and sunscreen. Special care should be taken for individuals with sensitive skin or pre-existing dermatological conditions. Close monitoring during and after treatment is necessary."	"(Avoid sunlight, Use sunscreen frequently, Report severe reactions, Adjust dosage if necessary, Monitor for irritation)"	"Jeising, S., Geerling, G., Guthoff, R., & Hänggi, D. (2022).

5	Cyamemazine	Verteporfin	Cyamemazine may increase the photosensitizing activities of Verteporfin.	Moderate	"Cyamemazine combined with Verteporfin may elevate the risk of phototoxic effects, including severe sunburn, prolonged redness, and blistering of the skin. Long-term exposure without adequate photoprotection may lead to cumulative skin damage and increased risk of adverse events. Patients should follow strict photoprotection measures and report any abnormal skin reactions promptly."	"(Avoid sunlight, Wear UV-protective eyewear, Apply sunscreen, Monitor redness, Seek medical care if symptoms worsen)"	"Dhalla, M. S., Blinder, K. J., & Shah, G. K. (2000).

6	Temoporfin	Verteporfin	Temoporfin may increase the photosensitizing activities of Verteporfin.	Moderate	"Temoporfin, when used with Verteporfin, can lead to an enhanced phototoxic reaction characterized by erythema, blistering, and prolonged irritation. These reactions may persist for an extended period and require medical intervention. Patients with a history of photosensitivity are at higher risk. Photoprotection measures such as minimizing UV exposure and wearing protective clothing are essential."	"(Limit UV exposure, Use SPF 30 sunscreen, Wear sunglasses, Monitor blistering, Seek medical attention)"	"Jeising, S., Geerling, G., Guthoff, R., & Hänggi, D. (2022).

7	Methoxsalen	Verteporfin	Methoxsalen may increase the photosensitizing activities of Verteporfin.	Moderate	"Methoxsalen may exacerbate the photosensitizing effects of Verteporfin, leading to significant erythema, peeling, and blistering of the skin. Ocular symptoms such as photophobia and vision disturbances are also possible. Patients should adhere to strict photoprotection measures and report any persistent or worsening symptoms immediately. Medical intervention may be required in severe cases."	"(Avoid UV exposure, Use high-SPF sunscreen, Wear protective clothing, Monitor redness, Report persistent irritation)"	"Dhalla, M. S., Blinder, K. J., & Shah, G. K. (2000). Photodynamic therapy with Verteporfin in age-related macular degeneration.
